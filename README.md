# Robot Framework TestFX Library

Altran developed and open sourced a test library for Robot Framework to enable to create automated test scripts to test Java FX applications using the TestFX framework. 


## Introduction

Our library is based in [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) a simple and clean testing framework for JavaFX with fluent and clean API that uses Junit.

The goal of the TestFX Library, is to wrap the main features of TestFX in a Robot Framework library that could be easy to use.

The library was created in Java (using Robot Framework Javalib Core). This makes that the RF scripts must be runned with Jython instead of Python.


## Getting Started

1. Install Robot Framework
2. Install Jython
3. Download TestFXLibrary.jar
4. Add the JavaFX application under test and TestFXLibrary.jar to the classpath
5. Create a Robot Framework script
6. Run the test with Jybot!

### Download

The library JAR can be downloaded in [releases](https://github.com/Altran-PT-GDC/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library/releases).

### Classpath

In order to execute the library and the application in Robot Framework, you need to add both application under test and TestFX library jars to CLASSPATH. See [here](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#configuring-path) how to do it.

### Import

Import TestFxLibrary in Robot Framework:

    *** Settings ***
    Library TestFXLibrary

### Example Test Case

    *** Settings ***
    Library TestFXLibrary

    *** My Test Case ***

    Start Application   testapp.FxApplication
    Click On Component  \#buttonId
    Select From List View By Text   \#listViewId    Example Text
    Close Application
    
    
TIPS: 
- The parameter to Start the application is the package.JavaFXApplicationClass
- If your using an id (eg. #id) as locator you must escape the hash sign in the RF script (eg. \\#id)
- Please visit this [wiki](https://github.com/Altran-PT-GDC/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library/wiki/4.-Executing-Test-Scripts) page for more information on how to run the scripts

### Keyword Documentation

You can find the keywords documentation [here](https://rawgit.com/Altran-PT-GDC/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library/master/docs/TestFXLibrary.html)

### Locators / Queries

Like in TestFX you can use several types of queries to interact with JavaFX components:

    # using a text query
    # click on a component (eg. a button) that has the text "OK"
    
    Click On Component  OK  
    
    # using a CSS class query
    # Click on a component (eg. a button) that has the class "button"
    
    Click On Component  .button  
    
    # using a CSS id query
    # Click on a component (eg. a button) that has the id "okbutton"
    # Don't forget to escape the hash
    
    Click On Component  \#okbutton     
    
Please see this [wiki page](https://github.com/Altran-PT-GDC/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library/wiki/5.-Identifying-Locators) for more information.

### WIKI

For more information visit this repository [Wiki](https://github.com/Altran-PT-GDC/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library/wiki).

### Tools to help component discovery

ScenicView - It will show all the component id's, locators and properties for a JavaFX application. You can find more info about Scenic View [here](http://fxexperience.com/scenic-view/).

### Prerequisites for running tests

[Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework)

[Jython](http://www.jython.org/)

### Installing

First you will need to Robot Framework and jython, for Robot Framework [here](http://robotframework.org/MavenPlugin/examples/javalibraries.html) and for Jython 
[here](https://wiki.python.org/jython/InstallationInstructions). This will enable you to run tests using Jybot.

Then you need to make sure that the Path is configured. See here how to do it 
[here](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#configuring-path).




# TestFX Library for Developers 

This is an open source project, if you are developer you can clone this project, change the code, compile it, etc. And, of course we're realy open for contribuition. New features, additional keywords, bug reports and documentation are welcome!

The library is writen in Java and the tests for the library are writen in Robot Framework, that run against a sample JavaFX application.


## Prerequisites

Besides Robot Framework and Jython we have the following additional prerequisites: 

[Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 


## Cloning the TextFXLibrary project

Clone repository to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/altranpt/Robot-Framework-Test-FX-Library.git
```

## Running the library unit tests

To run unit test via Maven, you only need to execute this command in command line : 

```
mvn test
```

Remember that you need to execute the command on the folder where you have the project.

If you have added any keyword on the project, you will need to add the test script on the test folder to the correct 
test suite. 


## Compiling

If you want to compile the project without running the tests you must execute the command in command line:

```
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

If you want to run the tests in a headless environment you must to execute the command in command line:

```
mvn clean test -Dtestfx.robot=glass -Dglass.platform=Monocle -Dmonocle.platform=Headless -Dprism.order=j2d
```


## Deployment

Once you've configured your repository deployment information correctly deploying your project's artifact will only 
require invocation of the deploy phase of the build:

```
mvn deploy
```


## Built With

* [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) - The JavaFX test framework - we're using TestFX 4.0.6-alpha.
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) - Java version.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [RobotFramework](http://robotframework.org/MavenPlugin/examples/javalibraries.html) - To run phyton test cases in 
java projects
* [RobotFramework Javalib Core](https://github.com/robotframework/JavalibCore) - Javalib Core is a common core for all Robot Framework test libraries written in Java.
* [Monocle](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testfx/openjfx-monocle/1.8.0_20) - To run the library tests in 
headless mode.
